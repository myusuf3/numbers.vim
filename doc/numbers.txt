1. INTRODUCTION                                                *numbers-intro*

The |numbers| plugin intelligently alternates between relative numbering
(|relativenumber|) and absolute numbering (|number|) for the active window
depending on the mode you are in. In a GUI, it also functions based on whether
or not the app has focus.

Commands are included for toggling the line numbering method and for enabling
and disabling the plugin.

2. CONFIGURATION                                       *numbers-configuration*

                                                            *g:enable_numbers*
g:enable_numbers~

Default: 1

If you want to disable contextual switching on startup, you can do the
following: >

    let g:enable_numbers = 0
<

For convenience you may want to add a mapping for |:NumbersToggle| and
|:NumbersOnOff|. For example: >

    nnoremap <F3> :NumbersToggle<CR>
    nnoremap <F4> :NumbersOnOff<CR>
<

3. COMMANDS                                                 *numbers-commands*

:NumbersToggle                                                *:NumbersToggle*
    Switch between |relativenumber| and |number|.

    Note that this toggles the kind of line numbers being shown -- it does not
    toggle the plugin itself. For that, see |:NumbersOnOff|.

:NumbersEnable                                                *:NumbersEnable*
    Enable contextual |relativenumber| / |number| switching.

:NumbersDisable                                              *:NumbersDisable*
    Disable contextual |relativenumber| / |number| switching.

:NumbersOnOff                                                  *:NumbersOnOff*
    Toggle the status of contextual |relativenumber| / |number| switching.

    If it was enabled, |:NumbersDisable| will be called. Conversely, if it
    was disabled, |:NumbersEnable| will be called.

I would like to thank Steve Losh and the nice people in #vim on IRC for all
their help.
